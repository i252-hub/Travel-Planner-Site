# Project Overview
### Challenge

Travlog is a travel enterprise that managed 
destination tour available by providing
travel destinations around the world. They have
put a lot of effort in providing a seamless experience
through its current features, but now they want to
go beyond and not just provide these functions, but also
tools to help travelers manage their travel and money better.

Seeing an opportunity to make a difference and help
them with their tour planning, they now want to develop
an itinerary that connects multiple points of interest including
low budget options for transportation and desired length of stay in each location.

# Objectives
• Design a new tour planning management feature that embeds
	multi-destination itinerary that includes desired length of stay in each location and offering low-cost of transportation. <br>
• Design a responsive website that is easy to use and allows customers to browse through all different trip categories
and details, filtering via interests and classifications created.

# Project Scope
Responsive Website, Adding features 

# Tools
Figma, Miro

# 01 Research
## Research Plan
Research enables me to dig deep into my understanding of users
not only their immediate frustrations, but also their hopes, fears, abilities, limitations, reasoning, and goals. It lays essential foundations for creating solutions
in later stages. <br>
 
To ensure the research stays on track and better guide the responsive website
design later, it is important to create a research plan before diving into the
research phase. I listed research goals, research questions, assumptions,
methodologies, participants, and timeline in my research plan.

## Research Goals
- Understand the market and identify target groups <br>
- Uncover people's travel booking experiences <br>
- Learn about how existing travel booking services cater to users' needs as well as their strengths and weaknesses <br>
- Learn about the preferences, frustrations, goals, needs, and motivations of target groups

## Methodologies
 - Secondary Research (Market Research, Competitive Analysis)
 - Primary Research (User Interview)

# Secondary Research
## Market Research
While Travlog is relatively new, it is likely to fit into the global travel and experience
market that has been established for a long time. Therefore, it is important to get
a big picture of the market - to get a sense of what we know and don't know yet,
who the audience are, as well as what the recent trends or news are.

### Selecting a place
- Search engines and family/friend recommendations are more likely to
be consulted; As process continues, they will use online travel agents
and hotel/airline sites to narrow their options (Expedia, 2018)

### Expectations on booking
- 70% of expected travelers prioritize flexible booking more than ever. Buying travel that has lenient cancellation, rebooking or refund policies is considered more important now than in pre-COVID days (Phocuswright). <br>
- 63% prefer to read reviews, view pictures and book online all on the same website
that offer customers a 'one-stop shop' (Salecycle, 2020). <br>
- 72% of new customers won't book until they have spent time reading other traveler's reviews (Salecycle, 2020)

### Demographics
- Young travellers, particularly Gen-Z and Millenials heavily trust and rely on
online reviews. (Salecycle, 2020). <br>
- Low-income travelers prioritize quality time with friends and family on trips,  and middle-income travelers prioritize sightseeing and tourism. The highest earners see travel as a chance to relax (Expedia). <br>
- For family travellers, 95% said their priority was keeping their families
entertained and happy, as well as deals and value (89%) and planning
travel around school holidays (85%) or near major attractions or theme
parts (85%) (Short Term Rentalz, 2019). <br>
-Solo Travel is growing for the millennial travel segment and Gen Z
audience, but is becoming more sociable where co-living apartments
are being introduced to allow travelers to meet like-minded individuals (CN Traveler, 2019; Travel Marketing Report, 2019)

## Competitive Research
It is equally important to research enterprises that pioneer in the travel
and experience package market, as their solutions to similar problems will
help me gather insights about their strengths and weaknesses. These insights
also help me identify gaps in features that Travlog might address.

## Primary Research
### User Interview
Building on a general understanding of the market and the audience, it is time to dive deeper and build real connection with our user and gain direct insights on them by primary research.

### Empathy Map

### Insights
- Users determine their travel time availability prior to their selection of the travel destination. <br>
- User search forums and blogs for travel inspirations. <br>
- Users always try to find the cheapest deal. <br>
- Users are not in favor of packaged tours.

### Needs
- Users need to know the proper travel duration for each destination. <br>
- User need to know if destinations satisfy their interests. <br>
- User need to find and compare affordable deals. <br>
- Users need to have flexible travel arrangements.

# 02 Strategy
## How Might We...
To define the problem I am going to solve, I create Point-of-view (POV)
Statements that allow me to ideate in a goal-oriented manner, and How-
Might-We (HMW) Questions to frame the ideation in the brainstorm session
for solutions. The statements and questions are generated based on the insights
and needs I gathered in my Empathy Map.

- How might we let users know the proper travel duration for each destination?
- How might we let users know if destinations satisfy their interests?
- How might we let users find and compare affordable deals?
- How might we let users have flexible travel arrangements?

## Brainstorm

### Individual Brainstorm
Centering on these questions, I then brainstormed solutions. I spent
5 minutes on each HMW question, and moved on to the next HMW
question when the time is up. I then did a second round for each question,
and finally arrived at my brainstorm results.

# 03 Design
## Task Flow
To decide what I am designing, identifying the main flow of users
when completing a task helps me to direct my focus on designing
specific pages. By creating task flows that center on key functions of
Travlog, I was able to think through the necessary steps and
examine the user experience in details. Below is the task flow for
a user who wants to book a trip on Travlog.

## Userflow
Building on the task flow, I mapped user flows whose scenarios
correspond to the established tasks. This process helps me incorporate
pages I need to design for users to successfully complete those tasks.

## Wireframe
I started sketching different versions on responsive desktop pages, capture
my ideas by pen and paper quickly. It enables me to examine
my ideas before putting everything in the daunting process
of digitizing.

## Responsive UI Design
I created responsive UIs by applying established styles. It further lets me to examine the overall
aesthetic feelings and visual balance of the website.
