# Project Overview
### Challenge

Travlog is a travel enterprise that managed 
destination tour available by providing
travel destinations around the world. They have
put a lot of effort in providing a seamless experience
through its current features, but now they want to
go beyond and not just provide these functions, but also
tools to help travelers manage their travel and money better.

Seeing an opportunity to make a difference and help
them with their tour planning, they now want to develop
an itinerary that connects multiple points of interest including
low budget options for transportation and desired length of stay in each location.
